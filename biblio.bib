we show how an arbitrary GSMDP can be approximated by
a discrete-time MDP, which can then be solved using existing
MDP techniques. The techniques we present can also be
seen as an alternative approach for solving SMDPs, and we
demonstrate that the introduction of phases allows us to generate
higher quality policies than those obtained by standard
SMDP solution techniques.},

  abstract={In the last decade, machine learning, and in particular
data mining, has become very popular in a world flooded with data.
Most learning systems however, use a limited representation of the
examples and the learned hypotheses. In this dissertation, we discuss
a general method to upgrade traditional machine learning and data mining
techniques from a simple propositional and single table representation
of the data and the knowledge, towards a powerful first order and multi
relational representation. 

In a first part, we introduce the task of concept learning, where the
aim is to induce general knowledge based on specific observations,
and we formalize the propositional and attribute value framework from
a logical perspective. To overcome the limited expressiveness of the
propositional framework, a nine-step method is described in detail
to upgrade an existing propositional learner towards first order logic.
This approach has several advantages. Firstly, we can profit from the
existing research and expertise w.r.t. propositional learners and inherit
its efficiency and effectiveness. Secondly, the first order system
is closely related to its propositional counterpart such that they
return identical results on propositional data, and in addition, the
relational learner is relatively easy to use and understand by a user
familiar with single table machine learning and data mining. As an
illustration of the method, we upgrade a simple propositional rule
learner to induce a first order DNF and CNF based hypothesis. 

In a second part, the method is applied to the predictive rule learner
CN2. As a result, we have implemented the relational data mining system
ICL which learns first order DNF and CNF rules from structured data.
We have added several extensions to the basic ICL system to handle
numerical information through the use of discretization and to handle
more than two classes of examples. To show the robustness and effectiveness
of our implementation, we evaluate ICL through the successful application
on several propositional and relational data sets. 

Finally, we highlight two of our contributions in the Aladin project
which aims at the development of advanced and commercial relational
learning systems. We design an ``extended input interface'' to handle
input data in a uniform way and which allows the user to communicate
with a relational database through an ODBC interface. Secondly, we
discuss some efficiency improvements, in particular we focus on query
transformations. },

	abstract = {The question of whether it is possible to automate the scientific process is of both great theoretical interest and increasing practical importance because, in many scientific areas, data are being generated much faster than they can be effectively analysed. We describe a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. Here we apply the system to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments. We built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway. In biological experiments that automatically reconstruct parts of this model, we show that an intelligent experiment selection strategy is competitive with human performance and significantly outperforms, with a cost decrease of 3-fold and 100-fold (respectively), both cheapest and random-experiment selection.},

	abstract = { Many application domains make use of specific data structures such as sequences and graphs to represent knowledge. These data structures are ill-fitted to the standard representations used in machine learning and data-mining algorithms: propositional 		representations are not expressive enough, and first order ones are not efficient enough. In order to efficiently represent and 			reason on these data structures, and the complex patterns that are related to them, we use domain-specific logics. We show these logics can be built by the composition of logical components that model elementary data structures. The standard strategies of top-down and bottom-up search are ill-suited to some of these logics, and lack flexibility. We therefore introduce a dichotomic search strategy, that is analogous to a dichotomic search in an ordered array. We prove this provides more flexibility in the search, while retaining completeness and non-redundancy. We present a novel algorithm for learning using domain specific logics and dichotomic search, and analyse its complexity. We also describe two applications which illustrates the search for motifs in sequences; where these motifs have arbitrary length and length-constrained gaps. In the first application sequences represent the trains of the East-West challenge; in the second application they represent the secondary structure of Yeast proteins for the discrimination of their biological functions.},

		  mathematics and computer science. Beyond classical
		  application fields, like approximation, combinatorial
		  optimization, graphics, and operations research, graph
		  algorithms have recently attracted increased attention from

		  chemistry. Centered around the fundamental issue of graph
		  isomorphism, this text goes beyond classical graph problems
		  of shortest paths, spanning trees, flows in networks, and
		  matchings in bipartite graphs. Advanced algorithmic results
		  and techniques of practical relevance are presented in a
		  coherent and consolidated way. This book introduces graph
		  algorithms on an intuitive basis followed by a detailed
		  exposition in a literate programming style, with
		  correctness proofs as well as worst-case analyses.
		  Furthermore, full C++ implementations of all algorithms
		  presented are given using the LEDA library of efficient
		  data structures and algorithms. Numerous illustrations,
		  examples, and exercises, and a comprehensive bibliography
		  support students and professionals in using the book as a

  TITLE = {Generating Accurate Rule Sets Without Global Optimization},
  BOOKTITLE = {Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'98)},
  YEAR = {1998},
  PAGES = {144-151},
  PUBLISHER = {Morgan Kaufmann},
  ABSTRACT = {The two dominant schemes for rule-learning, C4.5 and RIPPER, both operate in two stages. 
First they induce an initial rule set and then they refine it using a rather complex optimization stage 
that discards (C4.5) or adjusts (RIPPER) individual rules to make them work better together. 
In contrast, this paper shows how good rule sets can be learned one rule at a time, 
without any need for global optimization. We present an algorithm for inferring rules by repeatedly 
generating partial decision trees, thus combining the two major paradigms for rule generation-creating 
rules from decision trees and the separate-and-conquer rule-learning technique. 
The algorithm is straightforward and elegant: despite this, experiments on standard datasets 
show that it produces rule sets that are as accurate as and of similar size to those generated by C4.5, 
and more accurate than RIPPER's. Moreover, it operates efficiently, and because it avoids postprocessing, 
does not suffer the extremely slow performance on pathological example sets for which the C4.5 method has been criticized.},

@article{jakeman.EMS06,
    abstract = {Models are increasingly being relied upon to inform and support natural resource management. They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users. To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise; documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance; and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy, limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership, between model developers, clients and other interested parties.},

and instance based learning systems, need a measure for the distance
between objects. Adequate measures are available for attribute value
learners. In recent years there is a growing interest in first order
learners, however existing proposals for distances between non-ground
atoms have some drawbacks. In this paper we develop a new measure for
the distance between non-ground atoms.},

  Il existe des m\'ethodes qui s'attaquent à ce problème en inf\'erant des langages sous forme d'automates finis. Dans ce contexte des heuristiques performantes existent lorsque le nombre d'exemples est important [Oncina92,Lang92,Pr98]. 
  Les algorithmes d\'evelopp\'es partent habituellement d'un automate apprenant par coeur les exemples, puis le g\'en\'eralisent sous le contrôle des contre-exemples. 
L'approche propos\'ee dans cet article est compl\'ementaire: nous partons de l'automate 
le plus g\'en\'eral que nous sp\'ecialisons sous le contrôle des exemples et des contre-exemples.

  eabstract = {Learning a regular language from examples and counter-examples is known to be a NP-complete problem [Angluin78,Gold78]. Still, several heuristic methods have been proposed to tackle it by inferring finite automata. They give good results when the learning sample is large enough  [Oncina92,Lang92,Pr98]. These algorithms generally start from the most specialized automaton built on the examples and generalise it with respect to the counter examples. 
In this paper, we propose a different method: to start from the most general automaton and to specialize it with respect to the examples and the counter-examples.
